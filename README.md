Student: Soona Cheon

1. Overview of Election Audit: 
The purpose of this project is analyzing the election data using poserful Python to find out the outcomes.
The csv file consists the election voting results from 3 counties for 3 candidates, we analized the data, and write the report with detailed election results using Python.

2. Election-Audit Results: 
I will use the text outcome straightforward here. According to the text report:

1) How many votes were cast in this congressional election? 
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369,711
-------------------------
2) Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
-------------------------
County: Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
County: Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
County: Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
-------------------------
3) Which county had the largest number of votes?
County: Denver: 82.8% (306,055)

4) Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
-------------------------
Candidate: Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
Candidate: Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
Candidate: Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
-------------------------
5) Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
-------------------------
Final Election Winner!: Diana DeGette
Winning Vote Count: 272,892
Winning Percentage: 73.8%
-------------------------
6) Election-Audit Summary: (In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.)
 - finding 1: The candidate, Diana DeGette won the election prodominantly, and supported by majority of voters for 73.8% (272,892 out of 369,711).
 - finding 2: Among 3 counties, Denver has the most County: Denver: 82.8% (306,055), and it lead the winning for the candidate. 

I learend python is very hard to install and learn the syntax initally, but fund out it us a very powerful tool. Thank you.
